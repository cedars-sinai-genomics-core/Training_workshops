# Trainings
This page is the starting point for (hopefully) several tutorials that will show end users at Cedars-Sinai how to perform some common tasks using results we deliver to them. The plan is to have tutorials accompanying each of our major sequencing services, in order to provide researchers with robust, reproducible graphs for publication.

If there are additional tutorials you wish to see, please open an issue on this repository and describe the type of sequencing analysis you would like to see. The more detail, the better.
